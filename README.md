`bls-signatures` is a cross-platform library implementing BLS12-381 primitives for Dash built on
the [`relic`](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic) toolkit with bindings available in
[Python](./binds/python), [Rust](./rust-bindings/), [Go](./go-bindings/) and [Javascript](./js-bindings).

## Dependencies

* A C++17 capable compiler (GCC 9, Clang 7 or higher)
* CMake 3.18 or higher (or Autoconf 2.71 or higher; with libtool and automake)
* [`libgmp`](https://gmplib.org/) (for fast arithmetic, **optional**)

Additionally, the following dependencies are supplied by the codebase

* [`catch2`](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) (for tests)
* [`mimalloc`](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) (for secure memory operations)
* [`relic`](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic) (for cryptographic operations)

## Build library

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-config generators (like Visual Studio) place the binaries under a per-configuration directory, so on Windows the
> executables are at `src\Release\runtest.exe` and `src\Release\runbench.exe`.

```sh
# Create scratchpad directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure build files
cmake ..

# Build library with 4 threads
cmake --build . --parallel 4

# Run tests
./src/runtest

# Run benchmarks
./src/runbench
```

## Build Python binds

Our Python binds target Python 3.10 or higher; they depend on the following packages. Sample code is available
at [`binds/python/samples`](binds/python/samples).

* [`pybind11`](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) (bridging C++ and Python)
* [`pytest`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) (benchmarks and unit tests, part of optional `[dev]` dependency group)
* [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (linting, part of optional `[dev]` dependency group)

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using programs like [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage your virtualenv (`venv`) to prevent
> cross-contamination with Python-based native packages or other Python projects.

```sh
# Create a new venv named dashbls
uv venv dashbls

# Enter venv
source dashbls/bin/activate

# Install developer dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build binds
uv build

# Run linter and formatter
uv run ruff check
uv run ruff format --check

# Run unit tests
uv run pytest -v binds/python/test_unit.py

# Run benchmarks
uv run pytest -v binds/python/test_bench.py --benchmark-only
```
